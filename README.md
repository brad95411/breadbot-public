<h1>BreadBot</h1>

BreadBot helps, BreadBot does the things. Whatever things I'm willing to add to BreadBot. 

BreadBot is the breadiest bread. 

In all seriousness, BreadBot is my first real attempt at a Discord bot. I'm writing it such that it can really only be used in one server at the moment, although that will hopefully change in the future. The intention is really for it only to be used for the Team 2648 Discord server. 

I have a subset of features that I want it to have before I call it "production ready" and a set of features that I want if I'm feeling adventurous and want to put in a lot of work. 

"Production Ready" Features
- [ ] Google Calendar Integration for Event Management
    - [ ] Create/Manage/Remove Events and Calendars
    - [ ] Calendar Announcements for Upcoming Events
- [ ] Poll Creation and Results Announcements
- [ ] Conversation Archiving (May be Removed)

"Adventurous (Lots of Work)" Features
- [ ] BreadBot Voice Chat Hall Monitor
- [ ] Breadle (BreadBot Idle Bread Baking Game)
- [ ] BreadBot Calendar Send To Email
